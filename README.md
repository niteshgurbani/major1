<h1>Major Project: Automated teeth segmentation in X-ray images</h1>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
1.	Collect UFBA_UESC_DENTAL_IMAGES data set, composed of 1,500 annotated images, which allows the classification of X-rays in 10 categories.
2.	Using OpenCV extract the necessary features like the region of interest (ROI) from the dataset obtained.
3.	Implementation of threshold-based, cluster-based, region-based boundary-based, Sobel, Canny, Active contour without edges as well as Watershed-based models to come up with different insights. This step will allow for teeth detection and counting using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. 
4.	Development of an interactive dashboard to test and visualize the created model. The dashboard will allow the user to input an X-ray image and obtain the class of the image as output. The result will be backed by calculations from various models, some of which are mentioned above.
